It uses Google''c Colab for using GPUs, and Roboflow for generating Coco compatible image dataset.  It also caches weights for a trained model for reuse during inference operations.\n","\n","### **Tools and references**\n","Here are references to the tools used:\n","\n","Cars dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection\n","\n","Detectron2:  https://ai.facebook.com/tools/detectron2/\n","\n","Tesseract:  https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/\n","\n","Google Colab:  https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html\n","\n","Roboflow:  https://roboflow.com/\n","\n","Coco data format:  https://opencv.org/introduction-to-the-coco-dataset/#:~:text=COCO%20stores%20data%20in%20a,level%20description%20of%20the%20dataset\n","\n","A related reference: https://towardsdatascience.com/object-detection-in-6-steps-using-detectron2-705b92575578\n","\n","Image denoising:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37745519/use-pytesseract-ocr-to-recognize-text-from-an-image\n","\n","Computer Vision references:  https://courses.opencv.org/dashboard\n","\n","\n","Links to my dataset:  \n","\n","\n","\n","### **Approach**\n","\n","This notebook uses Google Colab for access to GPUs.  \n","The full pipeline uses the following steps:\n","\n","1.

Register Dataset:\n","    The dataset needs to be registered with detectron2 to be used.\n","    The dataset format should be compatible with Coco format (see \n","    references).  We used Roboflow to convert our data to Coco format \n","    (references)\n","6.  Visualize training data.

Infer and visualize predictions.  \n","\n","### **Note** \n","This notebook describes an end to end approach to detect license plates from car images.  I will update these notes with approaches which enhance the accuracy and execution time as I get additional information.\n","\n","###  **Summary**\n","We are usng detectron2 to localize the license plate bounding box of a car.  This localized license plate image is fed to an OCR tool like Tesseract for licens plate detection.  We could improve the accuracy of detection by denoising the image before feeding it to the OCR tool.  Another approach would be to use third party APIs for OCR function like:\n","\n","https://platerecognizer.com/alpr-results\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###1.
